This is a alpha version chat software, to install, please type ”make”, for more detailed instructions,
refer to the user manual.

For Succesful Login you must utilize these credentials:
Username: GUY
Password: ace

Features that work:
	Server is able to send and receive several requests from the clients
	Client can get basic input from user to start a login process.
	Client and server are able to encode or decode flags that represent commands for each side to execute.
	Clients are put in queue when they send message and are resent a message in order of first come first serve.
BETA Features:
	GUI now has a working login screen.  The login screen accepts the values from the GUI and sends them to the server.
	Although it will send initially, after a couple of submitting the same username and password, the program will segfault.  
	However, if you keep changing the information in the text boxes it will not segfault.

Features that do not work:
	Sign up and Login are not completely finished yet (data sends to the server, but there is no checking procedure yet).
	Database of users and conversations are not completely implemented yet (but we have started that)
BETA Features that do not work:
	After login screen, the actual messaging of the app does not work.  There needs to be a new window that opens where people can actually chat.
	The account creation does not actually work yet.
