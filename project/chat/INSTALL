Type tar -xvzf Chat_Beta_src.tar.gz, then cd Chat_Beta_src, then make.


Afterwards, one should run server first.
	The server can be run on a server such as crystalcove or bondi, followed by a port number (anything above 2000).
	For example it would look something like this "./server crystalcove 5312"

Next, run the GUI (which contains the client code).
	Make sure it is opened on the same port and host as the server.
	For example it should look like "./GUI crystalcove 5312"
